roadmap is as follows:

urgent : find people which will help in that project
any help is welcome (programming, hardware/ interfacing, app examples, translation, howtos...)
my big problem is, that I have only a very limitied timeframe to work on this project.
therefor any help is welcome

1.7.1 support for the hardware, asap

1.7.2 networking support via http. I plan to implement the possibility to access
	the state of the markers via http. together with that feature I plan to
	write some JAVA applets to make nice browser controlable GUI interfaces
	for sps programs. with that feature it would be possible to build
	distributed control ( e.g. 15 small ethernet connected DIL/PC work
	together, controled and visualized by a Browser like Netscape ).

?????? 	I want to rewrite the code to be object oriented. Its not very nice
to work with a lot of global variables and stuff
